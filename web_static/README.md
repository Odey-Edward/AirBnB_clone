**0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static**

* HTML
* CSS
* Front-end

**More Info & Best Practice:**    
During this project, I learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you canâ€™t apply any design.

In the last part of project(AirBnB clone) i finised working on the back-end and which is currently using a file storage for its Data storage, this project is based on improving Front-End.
